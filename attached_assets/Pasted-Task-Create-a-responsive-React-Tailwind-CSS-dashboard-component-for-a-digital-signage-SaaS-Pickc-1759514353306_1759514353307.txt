Task:
Create a responsive React + Tailwind CSS dashboard component for a digital signage SaaS (Pickcel). The dashboard should adapt to two user states:

New User (no screens added yet)

Engaged User (at least 1 screen + content published)

Only create the dashboard section (main content after login), not the entire app shell.

🎯 State 1: First-Time User Dashboard (Onboarding Mode)

The goal is to help users reach first value quickly: add a screen, upload content, and publish.

Layout should feel clean, minimal, and welcoming.

Elements:

Welcome Card (centered, large, friendly message) → “Welcome to Pickcel! Let’s set up your first screen.”

Primary CTA Button (large, colored) → “+ Add Your First Screen.”

Secondary Actions (smaller buttons):

Upload Media

Try a Template Playlist

Progress Indicator: Step 1 of 3 → Add Screen → Add Content → Publish.

Subtle illustration or iconography to make it visually engaging, but not cluttered.

Keep distractions low: hide metrics, reports, upsell banners at this stage.

🎯 State 2: Returning/Engaged User Dashboard

The goal is to surface useful information at a glance while keeping it clean.

Layout: 3-column grid (on desktop), stacked on mobile.

Sections to include:

Quick Actions Panel

Add Screen

Upload Media

Create Playlist

Screens Overview Card

Show total screens, online/offline count.

Status indicators (green for online, red for offline).

Compact list of last 3 screens (with status).

Content Overview Card

Number of media files uploaded.

Recent playlists.

Small thumbnail previews.

Reports Snapshot (lightweight)

Campaigns running.

Uptime %.

Only key highlights, no overwhelming data.

Tips / Learn More card (small, dismissible) → links to tutorials/templates.

Design principles:

Use white space generously; cards should be rounded, with soft shadows.

Keep primary CTAs visually distinct (blue/brand-colored).

Limit number of visible elements (max 5 cards).

Typography hierarchy: clear headlines (lg), body (base), captions (sm).

Icons from lucide-react or Heroicons for quick recognition.
